REQUIRED FEATURES
	Theme Config (theme.json)
		[!] Add shadow presets
		[!] Add duotones and gradients
	Header
		[!] Styles
			[!] Background color
			[!] Padding
		[!] Locations (left, middle, right, etc)
			This should almost entirely be handled by the Block editor being able to
				add/remove Group, Row, Stack, Column blocks
		[!] Set the "Site Title" block to be the "Site Logo" with the default logo being the infinitum logo in the assets/images folder
	Navigation
		[!] Drawers: Ability to create drawer (custom post type) menus, OR at minimum 
			need to be able to create "mega" menus that are full screen
			[!] Add a "site search" as the first block in the "starter content" for the starter drawer
		[!] Check to see if "menus" should be enabled/supported by the theme - right now they're not (BB Menu module doesn't work and also nav/drawers are just static links)
			Added it only when Beaver Builder is installed since it's not needed for the base theme
	Featured Image
		[!] Add a second "Featured Image" called "Header Image" that only displays on the top
			of "single" pages/posts
		[!] Add a theme customizable featured image ratio for the full size image and the thumbnail
	Footer
		Everything with the footer can be handled by the "Editor"
		[!] Styles
			[!] Background color
			[!] Spacing
			[!] Alignment
		[!] Locations
			These are no longer needed, but some content displayed in the footer may need to be
				converted into new blocks
	Template Tags
		May need to create some custom blocks to replace some template Tags
			or carry over some template tags that cannot be recreated as blocks
		[+] tag
	Styles
		This should be a replacement for "dependencies" that are compiled PHP files into CSS/JS.
		CSS variables will be critical to replace the need for PHP to generate dynamic CSS
	Blocks
		[!] Breadcrumbs
			A dynamic block to display breadcrumbs on content such as pages
			[!] Add a Beaver Builder Module that uses the render_breadcrumbs method so that it can be added
		[!] Drawer
			May be able to just use the WP Navigation Block (with the "Overlay Menu" set to "Always").
			Navigation block wasn't enough, so a custom Drawer block was created. Its features may
				need to evolve over time to adjust things like font colors, and background colors
			[!] Need to make the drawer display properly within the Editor (only show the Open button and icon)
		[+] Hook
			A block to trigger WP PHP actions or filters so plugins can output content
				in specific locations on templates, template parts, or page/post content
		[+] Social Share Links
			Can use the existing Social Icons block to display the icons and simply only need to update the URLs to be the proper "share" URLs for each platform
			This may be an opportunity to take advantage of the "block bindings API"
		[+] Add "Interactivity" support to all blocks
	Block Styles
		[+] Look into adding Block Styles to various blocks and what it would entail
	Block Variations
		[+] Look into adding Block Variations
	Block bindings (https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_bindings_source/)
		[!] Copyright
			Just need to be able to adjust the copyright holder name - default to the site title
	Patterns / Template Parts
		[+] Create some starter content for common full page layouts (page-about.php, or page-contact.php for example)
	Templates
		[+] Create some starter content for common page templates on a website and set them up so they'll show up in the pop-up when creating a new page (template-home-blog.php for example)
	Hooks
		[+] Add to this list all of the filters and actions that will be needed throughout
			various areas of the theme to maintain backward compatibility/functionality
	Integrations
		Beaver Builder
			[!] Custom "Advanced" tab settings for "Margin" and "Padding" that use the WP Theme preset values (1, 2, 3, 4, etc)
				[!] Thoroughly test overrides from full desktop size down to tablet and mobile
				[!] Improve the user experience by setting all settings for sizes smaller than desktop/default to "(inherit)" (which shouldn't render a CSS property) 
					so the values can properly cascade and its easy to tell what has been changed (regarding margins or padding at different responsive sizes)
			[!] Customize the "Font" settings to remove the font size and add in the WP Theme preset (80, 90, 100, 200, 300, etc)
			[!] Automatically set the page template to "Blank Full Width" when activating Beaver Builder so the full content space can be utilized
			[!] Filter the available fonts and add the theme.json fonts so they're the only ones that can be selected (or add to the "Theme Typography" field)
				[!] To disable Google Fonts it's probably best to use the Beaver Builder Advanced setting that's built in and disable using the toggle (by setting _fl_builder_google_enabled = '0')
					Upon theme activation run: update_option('_fl_builder_google_enabled', '0');
			[!] Add the Beaver Builder responsive size values (large, medium, responsive) as CSS variables to be used for media queries
			[+] Add theme spacing to the new "Box" module for "Spacing" > "Gap" and "Padding" and "Children" > "Padding"
		Auto Updates
			[!] Integrate EDD to distribute updates using integrated methods
				[!] Test to ensure that auto-updates are actually working
	Child Theme
		[+] Create a VERY basic child theme with the necessary config/setup to override basic parent theme settings (mostly theme.json)
